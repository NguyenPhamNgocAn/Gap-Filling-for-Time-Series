# Gap-Filling-for-Time-Series

The problem of missing values is often seen in time series. This is attributed to many reasons, such as collection fault, operation time, and natural conditions. Missing values significantly impact the outcome of an experiment. Therefore, proposing gap-filling techniques is essential to enhance the quality of data, thereby improving experimental results. In this repo, we apply various methods for filling in missing values, from 1-dimensional data to multi-dimensional data, such as Linear Interpolation, Spline and RBF.
